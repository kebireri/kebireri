## Hello!

I’m Kevwe, and I have a background in digital innovation and sustainable development. I’ve expanded that foundation into cloud and DevOps engineering, gaining practical experience through real-world projects and modern infrastructure practices. As I progress, I’m documenting what I learn and build, and sharing resources others may find helpful.

## Skills & Focus Areas
- **Cloud engineering:** compute, storage, networking, and secure access patterns  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform (primary) and Bicep  
- **Network security:** subnet design, NSGs, Bastion usage, and VNet peering  
- **Monitoring & observability:** diagnostic settings, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor, and KQL  
- **Automation & scripting:** Python fundamentals and CLI-based workflows  
- **DevOps practices:** Git workflows, structured repositories, and automation-driven delivery
 

## What I'm Learning
- Docker + container workflows
- Automation pipelines (CI/CD)
- Scaling applications

## Featured Projects
Here are some of the main hands-on projects demonstrating my cloud and IaC learning.

- [**Secure Networking with Bastion:**](https://github.com/kebireri/secureNetworking)
<br> A multi-phase Azure networking project that builds a secure hub-and-spoke architecture with NSGs, Azure Bastion access, VNet peering between VMs, and full network visibility through flow logs and traffic analytics.

- [**Terraform Static Website Deployment:**](https://github.com/kebireri/terraform/tree/main/projects/static_website) 
<br> A fully automated Terraform deployment of a static website with monitoring. It includes resource provisioning, automated content upload, diagnostic settings, and Log Analytics integration for real traffic analysis.
