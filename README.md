## Hello!

I’m Kevwe and I have a background in digital innovation and sustainable development. I’ve expanded that foundation into cloud and DevOps engineering, gaining practical experience through real-world projects and modern infrastructure practices. As I progress, I’m documenting what I learn and build, and sharing resources others may find helpful.


## 🧠 Learning Journey

### ✅ What I've Learned
- **Cloud Fundamentals:** Core concepts including shared responsibility, scalability, availability, global infrastructure, and cloud pricing.  
- **Azure Administration:** Working with compute, storage, networking, identity, resource groups, access control, and regional deployments.  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Deploying resources with Terraform, ARM, and Bicep. Understanding state, providers, variables, and modular patterns.  
- **Monitoring Basics:** Using Azure Monitor, diagnostic settings, and Log Analytics for log ingestion and analysis with KQL.  
- **CLI and Automation Foundations:** Using Bash, PowerShell, Azure CLI, Git, and common automation patterns.   

### 🚀 What I'm Learning
- **Cloud Operations:** Managing VM workloads, storage, networking, availability, cost governance, and operational controls.  
- **DevOps Foundations:** Version control workflows, GitHub collaboration, and introductory CI/CD concepts.  
- **Python and Scripting:** Automation basics, problem-solving, and scripting fundamentals.  
- **Docker Fundamentals:** Container basics, image creation, and container networking.  


## Featured Projects
Here are some of the main hands-on projects demonstrating my cloud and IaC learning.

- [**Secure Networking with Bastion:**](https://github.com/kebireri/secureNetworking)
    A multi-phase Azure networking project that builds a secure hub-and-spoke architecture with NSGs, Azure Bastion access, VNet peering between VMs, and full network visibility through flow logs and traffic analytics.

- [**Terraform Static Website Deployment:**](https://github.com/kebireri/terraform/tree/main/projects/static_website) 
    A fully automated Terraform deployment of a static website with monitoring. It includes resource provisioning, automated content upload, diagnostic settings, and Log Analytics integration for real traffic analysis.
