## Hello!

I’m Kevwe, and I have a background in digital innovation and sustainable development. I’ve expanded that foundation into cloud and DevOps engineering, gaining practical experience through real-world projects and modern infrastructure practices. As I progress, I’m documenting what I learn and build, and sharing resources others may find helpful.

## Skills & Focus Areas
- Cloud engineering: Working with compute, storage, virtual networking, secure access patterns, and identity controls.  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform and Bicep.  
- Network design and security: VNet segmentation, NSGs, Azure Bastion, and VNet peering for secure connectivity.  
- Monitoring and diagnostics: Log Analytics Workspace, diagnostic settings, Azure Monitor metrics, NSG flow logs, and KQL queries.  
- Automation and scripting: Python fundamentals for problem-solving and JSON handling, along with CLI workflows.  
- DevOps practices: Git version control, structured repositories, documentation, and an automation-focused approach to project delivery.  

## What I'm Learning
- Docker + container workflows
- Automation pipelines (CI/CD)
- Scaling applications

## Featured Projects
Here are some of the main hands-on projects demonstrating my cloud and IaC learning.

- [**Secure Networking with Bastion:**](https://github.com/kebireri/secureNetworking)
    A multi-phase Azure networking project that builds a secure hub-and-spoke architecture with NSGs, Azure Bastion access, VNet peering between VMs, and full network visibility through flow logs and traffic analytics.

- [**Terraform Static Website Deployment:**](https://github.com/kebireri/terraform/tree/main/projects/static_website) 
    A fully automated Terraform deployment of a static website with monitoring. It includes resource provisioning, automated content upload, diagnostic settings, and Log Analytics integration for real traffic analysis.
